## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
This project was good opportunity for practicing manipulation of html elements in javascript.<br>
I structured my code to update data in array and variables first using functions,<br>
then store them to local storage, following with rendering updated data to HTML.<br>
All starting with targeted click event.

- fetching data from json file
- Click event DOM manipulation
- setters and getters functions
- callback functions
- HTML picture element with control of images size depends on screen size
- using localStorage to store data


### Continued development

Continue in my path to develope frontEnd coding skills completing another project.


### Useful resources
